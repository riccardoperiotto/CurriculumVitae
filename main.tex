        Guided by my passion for studying and technology, I approached the world of ICT in high school and delved into the subject until I graduated in Trento. Between my bachelor’s and master’s degrees, I worked in the field to understand what my passion really was. I am now in the final year of my master’s degree in autonomous systems and my main goal is to develop software for robots. Industrial
        robotics, control, and deep learning are the subjects I prefer and I am ready to apply them to my next challenge!
